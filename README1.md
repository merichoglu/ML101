# ML101 - Episode 1

## Linear Regression Workshop

Welcome to the first workshop of our new series "ML101": "Linear Regression" for the METU ACM 24-25 season! This workshop is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of linear regression, from its theoretical foundations to practical implementation using Python. By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid grasp of linear regression and be able to apply it to real-world problems.

## Overview

### What You'll Learn

1. **Introduction to Linear Regression**
   - Understanding the concept of linear regression
   - Mathematical representation of linear regression (yes, we will be using the blackboard!)

2. **Implementation in Python**
   - Using `scikit-learn` for linear regression
   - Visualizing data with `matplotlib`
   - Performing mathematical operations with `numpy`

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Assessing the performance of linear regression models
   - Understanding key metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error, etc.

4. **Assumptions of Linear Regression**
   - Discussing the key assumptions behind linear regression like linearity, homoscedasticity, etc.
   - Techniques to check these assumptions

5. **Limitations and Overcoming Them**
   - Identifying the limitations of linear regression
   - Strategies to address these limitations

6. **Real-World Application**
   - Solving a real-world problem using linear regression
   - Applying the learned concepts in practice

## Prerequisites

- MATH 119 (Calculus I), MATH 120 (Calculus II), MATH 260 (Linear Algebra), CENG 222 (Statistical Methods), STAT 363 (Linear Models) are MUSTs. Said no one ever. But they are nice to have. Just kidding. You don't need to have taken these courses to attend the workshop. We will cover the necessary mathematical concepts during the workshop.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming (printing "Hello, World!", defining variables, being able to write or call functions, being familiar with class syntax of Python, etc. Not much honestly. We will cover what is needed.).
- Familiarity with fundamental mathematical concepts like linear algebra (matrices, vectors, etc.) and calculus (derivatives, integrals, etc.) would make things easier for you, but we will explain everything you need to know.
- Don't worry, we will cover the necessary mathematical concepts during the workshop!

## Libraries Used

- **scikit-learn**: For implementing linear regression models and evaluation metrics
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results
- **numpy**: For performing mathematical operations and data manipulation

## Workshop Structure

1. **Notebook to follow**
   - The workshop content is provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks. You can follow alongwith the code and explanations in the notebooks.
   - The notebooks will be available in the workshop repository, so you can access them any time you want.

2. **Hands-on coding**
   - We will be writing code during the workshop to implement linear regression models, visualize data, and evaluate model performance. We encourage you to write the code along with us to get a hands-on experience. We also provided some questions for you to solve on your own during the workshop.
   - You can ask questions at any time during the workshop. We are here to help you! There will be several breaks during the workshop, so you can ask questions during those times as well.
   - Volunteers will be available to help you with any issues you may encounter, related to the workshop content or otherwise. Just raise your hand, and we will be there to assist you.

3. **Theory and Mathematics**
   - The field of artificial intelligence and machine learning is based on mathematical concepts. Actually, it's 90% linear algebra, and 10% calculus.
   - Understanding these concepts is crucial for building a strong foundation in machine learning, so we will cover the necessary mathematical concepts during the workshop.
   - We will explain the theoretical concepts behind linear regression and the mathematical operations involved. We will also provide real-world examples to help you understand the concepts better.
   - We will use the blackboard to explain the mathematical concepts. Don't worry if you are not familiar with the mathematical notation. We will explain everything in simple terms. Again, if you don't understand something, feel free to ask questions.
